---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhanNhatLoi/crawler-exchange-vcb-bank.git
cd crawler-exchange-vcb-bank
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```
3. Install Puppeteer and Chromium
Puppeteer automatically downloads a compatible version of Chromium when you install it. However, you can also configure it explicitly.

```bash
npm install puppeteer
# or
yarn add puppeteer
```
Note: This will download a recent version of Chromium (~300MB). If you're deploying in a headless environment (e.g., Docker or Linux server), consider installing additional system dependencies like libx11, libxss1, or using puppeteer-core with a custom browser.
